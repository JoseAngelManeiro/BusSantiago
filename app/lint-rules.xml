  <!-- ScrollViews can only have one child widget.
  If you want more children, wrap them in a container layout. -->
  <issue id="ScrollViewCount" severity="warning" />

  <!-- FragmentContainerView replaces the <fragment> tag as the preferred way
  of adding fragments via XML. Unlike the <fragment> tag, FragmentContainerView uses
  a normal FragmentTransaction under the hood to add the initial fragment,
  allowing further FragmentTransaction operations on the FragmentContainerView
  and providing a consistent timing for lifecycle events. -->
  <issue id="FragmentTagUsage" severity="ignore" />

  <!-- This detector looks for usages of libraries where the version
  you are using is not the current stable release.
  Using older versions is fine, and there are cases
  where you deliberately want to stick with an older version.
  However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is available,
  and that is what this lint check helps find.
  Note: This issue has an associated quickfix operation in Android Studio and IntelliJ IDEA. -->
  <issue id="GradleDependency" severity="warning" />

  <!-- When setting text sizes, you should normally use sp, or "scale-independent pixels".
  This is like the dp unit, but it is also scaled by the user's font size preference.
  It is recommend you use this unit when specifying font sizes,
  so they will be adjusted for both the screen density and the user's preference.
  There are cases where you might need to use dp;
  typically this happens when the text is in a container with a specific dp-size.
  This will prevent the text from spilling outside the container. -->
  <issue id="SpUsage" severity="warning" />

  <!-- By default, this flag is set to true. When this flag is set to true,
  application data can be backed up and restored by the user
  using adb backup and adb restore. -->
  <issue id="AllowBackup" severity="ignore" />

  <!-- Unused resources make applications larger and slow down builds. -->
  <issue id="UnusedResources" severity="warning" />

  <!-- App is not indexable by Google Search;
  consider adding at least one Activity with an ACTION-VIEW intent filter. -->
  <issue id="GoogleAppIndexingWarning" severity="error" />

  <!-- If a View that overrides onTouchEvent or uses an OnTouchListener
  does not also implement performClick and call it when clicks are detected,
  the View may not handle accessibility actions properly.
  Logic handling the click actions should ideally be placed in View#performClick
  as some accessibility services invoke performClick when a click action should occur. -->
  <issue id="ClickableViewAccessibility" severity="warning" />
